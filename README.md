# 3D-GMPDCNN
Geological Modeling Using 3D Pixel-Adaptive and Deformable Convolutional Neural Network

PyTorch implementation of "Geological Modeling Using 3D Pixel-Adaptive and Deformable Convolutional Neural Network"

## Prerequisites
This codebase was developed and tested with pytorch 1.10.0 and CUDA 9.0 and Python 3.6.

## main models

### Deform_conv3D.py
This is the implementation of 3D deformable convolution in our network model

### Pixel-Adaptive_Conv3D.py
This is the implementation of 3D Pixel-Adaptive convolution in our network model

## Some of the statements
As all of our code is kept secret for the time being, only the core part of the code will be shown. In addition, both modules are the reference of "Deformable Convolutional NetWorks" and "Pixel-Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks". 
The whole code will be updated later.
